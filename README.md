# Search Algorithm Visualizer
Interactive and fun search algorithm visualizer that compares BFS to DFS. 

# General Facts
DFS and BFS worst case have the same time complexity. However they differ depends on the situation. 
BFS consumes more memory and slower generally compare to DFS
DFS however can go infinitely if the size of graph is inflate
