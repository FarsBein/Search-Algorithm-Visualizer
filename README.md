# Search Algorithm Visualizer
Interactive and fun search algorithm visualizer that compares BFS to DFS. 

# General Facts
DFS and BFS worst case have the same time complexity, O(V+E) = O(n). However, they are used differently depending on the situation.

BFS consumes more memory and is slower generally compare to DFS.

DFS however can go infinitely if the size of graph is inflate.

# Instruction on how to use
- Left click to draw on window and Right click to Erase 
- You have to draw the start and end node firsts before barrier
- Press D to solve using DFS
- Press B to solve using BFS
- Press R to remove the solving lines and maintain the drawing made by you
- Press space to remove everything
